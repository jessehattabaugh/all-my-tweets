# all-my-tweets
 not that they are worth saving

So I got suspended from Twitter, which is kind of a bummer because I was on there nearly every day since 2007. But honestly it wasn't good for me. I spent a lot of time on there just telling people they were wrong (which eventually got me suspended). It was a bad way to spend my energy, and it put me in a bad mood. 

Still I was sad that all the things I had written might be lost. So I found [a tool that could download all my Tweets](https://github.com/pauldotknopf/twitter-dump/). I installed .NET for the first time just to use it. The result is this .json file. Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair.
